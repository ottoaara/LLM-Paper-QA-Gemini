Chat with the knowledge extracted from the latest LLM research papers using this powerful Streamlit app backed by Google Gemini. 

## âœ¨ Features

- **Ask Questions:** Get insightful answers about LLMs based on information from uploaded research papers.
- **Upload & Process:** Easily upload multiple PDF research papers, and the app will automatically process and index them.
- **Powered by Google Gemini:** Utilizes the state-of-the-art Gemini language model from Google for accurate responses.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

**Locally (via Streamlit):**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [invalid URL removed]
   cd your-repo-name

**2. Install Dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt



(Make sure you have a virtual environment activated)

**3. Set Up Google API Key:**

Create a .env file in the project root directory.
Add your Google API key to the .env file: GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key

**4. Run the App:**
streamlit run app.py
The app will open in your web browser.

** On Google Colab:**

ðŸ”§ Code Structure

app.py: The main Streamlit application file.
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python libraries.
.env: (Not included in the repo) Stores your Google API key.
faiss_index/: (Created when papers are processed) Stores the vector database for efficient text retrieval.
ðŸ’¡ How It Works

Upload: You upload PDF research papers.
Process: The app extracts text from the PDFs, splits it into chunks, and creates a vector representation of each chunk using Google Gemini embeddings. These vectors are stored in a FAISS index.
Ask Questions: When you ask a question, the app:
Converts your question into a vector using the same embedding model.
Searches the FAISS index to find the most similar vectors (i.e., the most relevant text chunks from the papers).
Passes the relevant context and your question to the Google Gemini model.
The model generates an answer based on the information in the context.
ðŸ“š Example Usage

Upload some LLM papers to the app.
Ask a question like:
